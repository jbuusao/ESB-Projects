Email demo
==========

This app polls an outgoing folder, and sends all files to a given email recipient, via SMTPs
and polls an email recipient via POP3s, and stores all incoming mail in an incoming folder.
The two flows run in parallel and are independent from eachother.
The configuration works for GMAIL smtp and pop3
